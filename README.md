# Got60 App

Got60 is a social-gaming app that connects users in a localized area to engage in 60-second trivia rounds. Users can make non-monetary wagers and can then agree to meet-up for a more organic social interaction. Got60 is meant to function as the perfect ice-breaker and a user-profile rating system connected with the wagers keeps users honest about honoring their bets. Got60 is built with Rails and AngularJS on a PostgreSQL database while utilizing the Google Maps API to find nearby competitors. Got60â€™s next stage of development will be to have it written for mobile devices - Java for Android products and Swift for Mac iOS products.
